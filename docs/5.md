# Final tips and remarks

## Update script
The author wrote a POSIX-compliant shell script that automates the task of updating your served system. It can be found [here](https://github.com/Phenitei/ro-centos/blob/master/scripts/update-script) book's [source](https://github.com/Phenitei/ro-centos) repository. Feel free to use it, hack it and feedback on it as well!

## Caveats
None that we have found yet, but feel free to ask if you think anything is missing here. We won't bite :)

## Helpful debugging tips.
Use `dmesg`, `journalctl` and the `-v` flag. Everything encountered during our tests was included in the book, but if you find fault with something we wrote or have a helpful tip you think others should know, we will be happy to add it here!

## Conclusion
You should now have a robust working cluster that you can use for a number of different tasks and scenarios. We hope you had fun setting this up and that it will be of use. We are always happy to receive feedback and/or contributions, visit the [github sources](https://github.com/Phenitei/ro-centos) to open an issue, contribute, or just leave a comment on the book! Happy hacking :)

## Installing the master server
This machine is going to allow the clients to boot from the network using [PXE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment) and then serve them their system using [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System). The server's setup is distribution independant as all major distributions support PXE and NFS, but for simplicity CentOS 7 will also be used. You must first install a base CentOS 7 system, using whatever guide you wish, good resources are the CentOS [wiki](https://wiki.centos.org/), and [this guide](http://www.tecmint.com/centos-7-installation/). Once you are satisfied with you setup, come back to this guide.

### PXE server
Setting up a PXE server is very well documented on the web, so writing another guide here would be quite useless. Good resources I have found and used are:

* (for the server-side, also if you use VMs as clients) [this guide](https://websetnet.com/install-pxe-server-and-configure-pxe-client-on-centos-7/). You may want to note that IPTables is disabled in this guide, which *should* be a security concern to you. Be sure to have a firewall!
* The [official guide](https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/PXE/PXE_Setup/) from the Centos 7 wiki, unfortunately very outdated... (xinetd is deprecated).
* A very comprehensive [guide](http://www.tecmint.com/install-pxe-network-boot-server-in-centos-7/) to be adapted to your setup (in particular the networking section with DNSMasq).

### NFS server
You will need a functional NFS file server on this machine to serve the system files to the clients. NFS allows different client computers to access files on a server computer using a protocol that makes them emulate a block device, allowing the "NFS share" to be mounted and manipulated as if it were a block device. 

First create the directories where you will store the client's data:
```
master:~# mkdir -p /data/cluster/system
```
Then, install the nfs server by installing the following packages: 
```
master:~# yum install nfs-utils nfs-utils-lib
```
Configuration of which server-side directories we want NFS to export is done in /etc/exports, so you will want to edit that file and add the following line:
```
/data/cluster/system <ip range of allowed clients>(<NFS OPTIONS>)
```
Different options are available for NFS shares mounting, you can gind the full list with `man 5 nfs`. Here are the main ones that we will want to use:
* `rw` or `ro`: At least during the setup, you will have to export the files allowing read/write (`rw`). If there are strong security concerns, you can then only export it as read-only, but it should not be necessary as the clients will mount the shares with the read-only option, and one needs to be root to change mount options (either by editing the `/etc/fstab` file or by using the `mount -o remount,rw` command).

If you are running a diskless setup, you will also want to create directories to store each client's state. These directories must all be under the same top level directory and should be named after each client's FQDN (the clients will receive their hostnames from the network): `master:~# mkdir /data/cluster/state/client{1,2,...,n}.mytest.local` for example.
